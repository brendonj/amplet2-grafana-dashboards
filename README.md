# amplet2-grafana-dashboards

The [AMP active measurement system](http://amp.wand.net.nz) is a set of
software that is designed to perform continuous, distributed, black-box active
network measurement.

This package contains some useful default Grafana dashboards for use with
data collected by AMP.

Add a dashboard to your Grafana instance using the ```import``` button on the
dashboard management page, and upload the appropriate json file.

Alternatively, prebuilt Debian/Ubuntu packages are hosted by
[Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~wand/repos/amp/packages/).
